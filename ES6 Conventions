ES6 Conventions

Use const by default.
Use let if you have to rebind a variable.
Use var to signal untouched legacy (old) code, that is avoid using var and use let going forward instead.

CRUD - Create, Read, Update and Delete.

HTTP Method -- CRUD Action

       GET  --  Read
      POST  --  Create
       PUT  --  Update
    DELETE  --  Delete

To create PUT and DELETE requests we would need to use a workaround known as HTTP Method Override, but for simplicity we will make do with just GET and POST. Instead of PUT and DELETE, we will use POST.
